# get_apps

## Intro
This started when I was using Arch linux, and not trusting some AUR repos, so I got the files myself from the official repos (many times from the official github)  and so. Now even using other repos, I think
it is quite comfortable for me to use....

## How it works
It automatically fetches the pacakges with the specified version (1pasword/bitwarden are taking the latest version so no need to specify it), so for example if I want to get 
the last version of bitwarden, I just need to execute:

```
sudo get_bitwarden.sh 

```
And it will create the `/opt/bitwarden` and download there the packages, then after it will create the menu for desktop, and shortcut with the icon. 

For example if you want to get the Tidal Hi-Fi version 6.0.1, just run:

```
sudo get_tidal.sh 6.0.1

```

and that's it :)
