# get_apps

## Intro
To get some applications in Arch directly from the Applications Official Repos

Actually since I am not trusting much in the AUR repos, I decided to do some stupid scripts for getting the software I need directly from the source of those applications.

I have just done this in not 1h time, so whenever I have time I will improve all these repetitive code and so, now I just wanted to get the software fast ... :) 


The destination path I have is `/opt` it will create links in `/usr/local/bin` ... So don't forget to add the `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin` in your .profile/.bashrc/.zshrc :) 

## What software I have at the moment 
* 1password
* bitwarden  
* brave
* logcli (from Grafana)
* Microsoft Visual Code
* Packer
* Postman
* Terraform
