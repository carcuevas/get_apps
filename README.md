## Intro
To get some applications in Arch directly from the Applications Official Repos

Actually since I am not trusting much in the AUR repos, I decided to do some stupid scripts for getting the software I need directly from the source of those applications.

I have just done this in not 1h time, so whenever I have time I will improve all these repetitive code and so, now I just wanted to get the software fast ... :) 


The destination path I have is `/opt` but it will create links in `/bin`  I could use `/usr/local/bin` and I may use in the future, but now I have how I have it...

## What software I have at the moment 
* 1password
* bitwarden  
* brave
* Microsoft Visual Code
* Packer
* Postman
* Terraform
